Founded in Cairo in 2019, Almena is an Egyptian design partnership founded by Abdallah Mekkawi and Abdelrahman Adel. The founders' careers have closely paralleled one another, starting with their shared academic journey at the same architecture school in Cairo.
Since its foundation, Almena has been deeply rooted in projects with vital social and environmental causes. This early focus reshaped our understanding of design and its role as a crucial tool for creating a meaningful impact to our built environment.
â€‹
 In 2021, we relocated to Dubai to get exposed to diverse architectural practices and new experiences architectural practices and gain fresh perspectives. Over the past seven years, we have continuously believed in our parallel practice, which enriches our community and broadens our perception of architecture by strengthening communities while respecting the region's climate, culture, and traditions.

With this ethos and a commitment to context-driven design, we aim to grow as architects who can drive impactful change in Egypt and the broader region, blending innovation with cultural authenticity.
